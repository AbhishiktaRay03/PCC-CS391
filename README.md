Here are some C programs that I did for the DSA paper of the 3rd semester in the 2nd year curriculum of BTech CSE.

**HOW TO INSTALL**
1. Create a C virtual environment.
2. Clone the repo : git clone https://github.com/AbhishiktaRay03/PCC-CS391.git or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory cd <folder_name>.
4. Run pip3 install gcc.
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.
   
**USAGE**
To run any program (without <math.h>), run  gcc filename.c -o name, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute; name = output executable file.

Then type  ./name, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

To run any program (with <math.h>), run  gcc filename.c -lm, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.

Then type  ./a.out, and then press Enter to execute successfully.


**FAQ**
How to stop the script? Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac)
For any other problems, feel free to raise an issue.
